<h2>College</h2>

<p> After High School I defiantly plan on going to college. I plan on going into college to get a degree in Civil Engineering. My top two choices for 
colleges right now are University of Texas Austin and Kansas State University. </p>

<p>I have always been a Longhorns fan since I was little. I have rooted for Texas every chance I get for any sport. I remember vividly going down to see a football 
game with my family. The atmosphere was great from all the students and fans, just walking around you could feel all the team spirit. When I started thinking of 
colleges Texas was right up there from the start. For more than just being a favourite school but for having a great engineering program. </p>

<p>Then I visited K-State. I went to K-State because of their engineering programs but when I went on campus I fell in love. The campus drew me in I loved every 
part of the campus. It had the feel of a smaller college but it is actually a large college. And not many people know this, even at K-State, but their QB Jake Waters
was born and raised in Council Bluffs Iowa and went to St. Albert's High School.</p>

<h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
<p>A long time ago I decided on what I wanted my career to be. I decided on Civil Engineering. It all started when a group of Civil Engineers came to my school in 
6th grade and gave a presentation on it. I fell in love with the idea of building bridges and the rest of the disciplines of civil engineering. <p>

<p>Civil Engineering has many disciplines and ranges from building bridges or water damns even to building roller coasters. That is what makes Civil Engineering 
so interesting to me. I am taking a class on Civil Engineering now, it is helping to teach me all about the disciplines and I think will help me to decide which 
discipline is the most interesting and right for me. Even though I decided I wanted to be a Civil Engineer a long time ago the more time that I put into it,
the more and more I become more interested.</p>
