<p>Born and raised in Council Bluffs, and I have lived in the same house since I was born. For elementary school I attended Pusey Elementary School, which is now shut 
shut down but a company made a deal with the school district to turn it into a recreational sports facility with bating cages and ect. After elementary I moved on to 
Kirn Middle school, and after a long time of debating the school mascot was recently changed to the Kirn Lynx in model of my High School, from the Kirn Eagles. I am 
currently a Junior at Abraham Lincoln High School, otherwise known as the AL Lynx.<p>

<p>I love sports I currently play baseball and tennis for my school. I have practices all year for at least one of my sports even in the off season. I always 
have something to do all year long. But my favourite part of the year is the College World Series. I have been to every CWS for at least one game since I was 
born. I also play guitar, I have for a fair amount of years and have gathered a collection of guitars. But in generally I am an average student I get good 
grades and get all my work done and don't cause trouble.</p>
